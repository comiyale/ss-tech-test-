# Steps i took
Using the vue project

## Question Two
Visit one of the repositories below, fork the repository, and then write all unit tests you feel are applicable. 
Once you have completed writing tests, add a .md file to the `src/question-2` directory with a link to your fork 
that contains the completed tests. **Pick either the React version OR the Vue 2 version depending on which framework 
you are more comfortable with.** You do not need to write tests for both frameworks, and no bonus points will be 
awarded for completing both. Both version use Jest.

* Vue 2 version - https://gitlab.com/eschmiedel/ss-vue-tech-test
